## Georgie is an Eliza-like AI built in Prolog.
This program was built as a part of CSCI 0351 at Drury University under the direction of Dr. Browning.

In order to run this program, one must navigate to 

https://www.swi-prolog.org/Download.html

and download SWI-Prolog.

Open SWI-Prolog and enter the filepath in the following format:

['filepath'].

['/Users/myprofile/desktop/prologfile.pl'].

Reminder: Every statement in Prolog must end with a period.

If SWI-Prolog returns true, then you are ready to query the program!

Keywords recognized by Georgie are included in the file.

In order to query Georgie you must use the following syntax:

georgie(['query'],X).

where the query must be an array.

For example, you might ask Georgie:

georgie([how,are,you],X).
